# ROS-Tutorials
Packages + Directories for practical application of ROS tutorials

The tutorials linked to their respective repositories are **not** step-by-step walkthroughs. Rather they expose you to the key ideas and concepts which are needed to complete the tutorial. Tutorials also generally contain a sample workflow which is meant to guide your focus as you implement the required functionality.
> **Note.** All directories contain a `CATKIN_IGNORE` file which exempt it from being built when running `catkin_make`. To build the packages in the desired directory, remove (delete) the `CATKIN_IGNORE` file.

Here is the current list of tutorials that are linked to this repository:
- [Simulation Tutorial](https://github.com/UTRA-ART/Caffeine/wiki/Simulation-Fundamentals): `/sim_tutorial`
- [Navigation Tutorial](https://github.com/UTRA-ART/Caffeine/wiki/Navigation-Fundamentals): `/navi_tutorial`

The overall ROS wiki written (not linked to any directory in the repo) can be found [here](https://github.com/UTRA-ART/Caffeine/wiki). It should provide you with plenty of background info and useful links to aid in learning how to use ROS.
